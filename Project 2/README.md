# Landing Page Project

## Overview

This project requires building a multi-section landing page. The functionality I used servers two purposes: to prepare us for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show us how Javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site.

## Feature

- The navigation menu will be updated automatically based on number of sections.
- When scroll the landing page, the page will automatically hightlight the active item in the navigation menu and the current section.
- When click on the navigation item, the page will scroll smoothly to the corresponding section.
- There is a _scroll to top_ button at the right bottom of the page. It will display when user scrolls down a little bit. If user clicks on it, the page will scroll up to the top and the button will be hidden.
- The page is well-responsive on desktop, tablet and phone browsers.
